Major Project 1:

Idea:

1. Reseach Paper Input.
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Parameters which concludes quality of research paper or any other paper. (No of Verb desc the quality of that article).
4. We have to analyze the article / data.
5. Based on the Analysis we have to rate the article/paper.
6. Web application for this.. 


Stack:

frontend: Streamlit
backend: Python
Modules:  for img to text or for seprating paragraphs in each paper.


Work to do:

1. Reseach Paper finding.. [Find Reaseach Paper Realted to giving rating to articles based on quality of content]
2. Find Parameters for the conclusion and deciding the quality of article.
3. UI
4. Data Preprocessing
5. Algorithm/File for finind quality 
6. Conclusion and results.
